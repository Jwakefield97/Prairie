# Prairie
Golang web application framework. 

## Building 
* place this project in your go path in the src folder under the folder prairie. Usually this would be Users\Myname\go\src\prairie. 
* navigate to the project and execute ``go run test/Server.go`` to run the test implementation. Alternatively you can implement the framework at any location by importing "prairie" given it is in your go path and go.exe is in the environment variable "path".
